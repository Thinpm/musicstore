# MP3 SaaS Backend Development Guide

This document provides technical information and guidelines for implementing the backend of our MP3 SaaS platform. It serves as the primary reference for backend developers working on this project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Runtime Environment** | Node.js |
| **API Framework** | Express.js |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (via Supabase) |
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth |
| **File Storage** | Supabase Storage |
| **Type Safety** | TypeScript |
| **API Testing** | Jest / Supertest |
| **Documentation** | OpenAPI / Swagger |

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Overview

The backend follows a layered architecture:

1. **API Controllers** - Handle HTTP requests/responses
2. **Services** - Implement business logic
3. **Models** - Define database schemas and type interfaces
4. **Middleware** - Handle authentication, logging, error handling
5. **Utils** - Reusable helper functions

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

- User authentication is implemented using **Supabase Auth**
- JWT tokens are used for maintaining user sessions
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented for features like:
  - Public vs. private tracks
  - Playlist sharing
  - Admin functions

## üíæ Data Storage

### Database Tables (PostgreSQL via Supabase)

- **users** - User profiles and account information
- **tracks** - Audio file metadata (title, artist, duration, etc.)
- **playlists** - Collection of tracks created by users
- **playlist_tracks** - Many-to-many relationship between playlists and tracks
- **favorites** - Users' favorite tracks
- **play_history** - Track play history for recommendations

### File Storage (Supabase Storage)

- **audio_files** - MP3 and other audio format storage
- **images** - Cover art, user avatars, playlist covers
- Use bucket policies to control access permissions

## üîå API Implementation Guide

1. **Review the API documents in this directory:**
   - `api-needs.md` - Comprehensive list of required endpoints
   - `schema-examples.json` - Expected data structures
   - `frontend-routes.md` - Frontend pages and their data requirements
   - `ui-behavior.md` - Special UI behaviors needing backend support

2. **Key API Features to Implement:**
   - User registration, login, and profile management
   - Track upload, streaming, and metadata management
   - Playlist creation and management
   - Track filtering (A-Z, genres, etc.)
   - Search functionality across tracks, playlists, and users

3. **Data Processing Requirements:**
   - Extract metadata from uploaded audio files (title, artist, duration)
   - Generate waveform data for audio visualization
   - Process and optimize cover images
   - Track play count and user activity for analytics

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key

# Storage Configuration
STORAGE_BUCKET_AUDIO=audio_files
STORAGE_BUCKET_IMAGES=images

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173

# Optional: External Services
AUDIO_PROCESSING_API=https://api.example.com/audio
```

## üìä Database Schema

Follow the schemas in `schema-examples.json` closely when designing your database. Key considerations:

- Use UUIDs for primary keys
- Include created_at and updated_at timestamps on all tables
- Set up appropriate foreign key relationships
- Define indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase

## üîÑ Real-time Features

Some features may benefit from real-time updates:

- Upload progress (via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events)
- Play count updates
- New playlist notifications
- Collaborative playlist editing

## üìù Implementation Notes

1. **Error Handling**
   - Return consistent error responses following the format in `schema-examples.json`
   - Log errors comprehensively for debugging
   - Provide user-friendly error messages

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Paginate results for lists of tracks and playlists
   - Optimize database queries with appropriate indexes
   - Use caching where appropriate
   - Consider implementing CDN for audio file delivery

3. **Security Best Practices**
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Implement proper access controls at the database level
   - Set up rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Follow OWASP security guidelines

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Configure your `.env` file
4. Set up Supabase tables and storage buckets
5. Run migrations and seed data if applicable
6. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

## üß™ Testing

- Write unit tests for all service methods
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Set up a test database with Supabase for testing

## üìö Additional Resources

- [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.io/docs)
- [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)

## ü§ù Working with the Frontend

- Review the frontend code to understand the expected data formats
- Check React Query implementations to see how data is consumed
- The frontend expects the API to be available at `VITE_API_URL` (from frontend `.env`)
- Default API URL is `http://localhost:3001/api`

---

Remember to follow the format described in `schema-examples.json` precisely, as the frontend expects specific data structures.
